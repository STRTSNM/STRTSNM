### Tech explorer • Efficiency-driven developer • Always building, always learning

I dig into systems at every layer, from kernel internals to GPU
pipelines to mobile boot chains.\
I like pushing hardware and software *way* past what they were designed
for. Phones aren't meant to dual-boot?\
Android devices aren't supposed to run full Linux distros?\
Boot images aren't meant to be swapped live?

I try anyway. And often, I get it working.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What I do

-   **Push boundaries**\
    Dual-booting phones, running Arch on non-Linux devices, bending
    Android's boot flow, bypassing limitations that "shouldn't" be
    bypassed.

-   **Low-level experiments**\
    ROM flashing, custom boot images, TWRP scripting, kernel tweaks,
    device tree exploration.

-   **Linux development**\
    Arch, PostmarketOS, LFS, terminal emulation, framebuffer work,
    systemd configs and whatnot

-   **High-efficiency software**\
    Cross-platform tooling, UDP-controlled
    interfaces, performance-focused scripts.

-   **Linux on Android**\
    Chroots, custom distros, HAL bypassing, experimenting with
    Treble/GSI workflows.

## Projects I'm exploring

-   [Ketta](https://github.com/STRT-Official/Ketta-Official) - yet another virtual assistant
-   [Zipip](https://github.com/strtsnm/zipip) - pip, but faster
-   [Zigit](https://github.com/strtsnm/zigip) - git, but faster
-   A Linux distro tailored for Android hardware , able to run on almost any device
-   Experiments that "shouldn't work," just to see if they can 💪

## Let's connect

If you're into making devices do things they were never designed for ---
or you enjoy efficiency, system hacking, or bold experiments --- we're
already on the same wavelength.
